{"name":"UnofficialDDNS","tagline":"A dynamic DNS service for regular registrars without native DDNS options.","body":"UnofficialDDNS is a Windows service which provides *Dynamic DNS* for regular registrars. Instead of signing up with a\r\ndynamic DNS provider and creating a CNAME record at your registrar to point to your dynamic DNS (for example:\r\nhomeserver.mydomain.com -> alfred1986.dynamicdnsprovider.info), UnofficialDDNS cuts out the middle man and creates A\r\nrecords directly.\r\n\r\nWhen installed, UnofficialDDNS removes all existing A and CNAME records from the domain you specify (for example,\r\nhomeserver.mydomain.com or mydomain.com if you'd like) and adds a new A record which the IP address of the computer\r\nrunning UnofficialDDNS. By default the service checks if your IP address changed every hour, and if it fails (no\r\ninternet, etc) it retries in 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupported Registrars\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nCurrently **Name.com** is the only supported registrar.
